IDEAS:

-add/edit categories
-make default date today for form fields

-connect owed expenses to venmo somehow
-ability to add owed expenses to expense list
-ability to check/uncheck owed expenses to mark as completed (but still have record)
-make addexpense for the tracking page a modal
-show/hide paid items on owed page
-on addItem form, add option to mark as expense and add it to epense list
-add tooltips to expense/item grid icons
-only add owed item to expense list one time
-when switching categories, month should remain the same
-edit category of expense
-organize what is details, name, etc etc for each type of item/expense
-when deleting item from tracked or expenses, make sure it deletes from both spots?? Or ask
-should 'things that people owe' also be tied to expenses or have the ability to add to/from expenses?



Q's:
-want an 'add expense' button for every category table on monthly page?
-should we show the category table even if no expenses are there for the month (on monthly page)?
